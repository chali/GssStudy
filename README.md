This is my research project for class Data Analysis and Statistical Inference (https://www.coursera.org/course/statistics) which I have done on Coursera.org.

I analysed a question whether there is a relationship between respondents political party affiliation and their confidence in major companies? I used data from General Social Survey (http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/)

Here are final results from peer review on Coursera: https://class.coursera.org/statistics-001/human_grading/view/courses/971086/assessments/4/submissions/5234
